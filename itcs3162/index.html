                <li>What is data mining? What are some examples of how data mining can be used?</li>
                <p>
                    Data mining is the process of extracting and finding patterns in massive data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, 
                    statistics, and database systems. Data mining can be used across various sectors, for example: fraud detection in banking/retail, intrusion 
                    detection in cybersecurity, and inventory management/supply chain efficiency in manufacturing.
                </p>
                <li>What are the different steps of the pipeline?</li>
                <p>
                    <u>Define goal/problem</u> - clearly identify the project's desired outcome of data mining implementation
                    <br><u>Collecting/understanding data</u> - collect and explore raw data to discover initial insights
                    <br><u>Data cleaning/pre-proccessing</u> - clean raw data, integrate/reduce, and transform into the dataset to be used for modeling
                    <br><u>Modeling data with algorithms</u> - apply various modeling techniques to the prepared data to achieve specific goals
                    <br><u>Evaluating model's performance</u> - evaluate the results to ensure they meet the project goals, identify if any steps need to be repeated
                    <br><u>Deployment</u> - implement the models into the real-world enviroment to fullfill the original goal
                </p>
                <li>Why is defining the problem first so important?</li>
                <p>
                    Defining the problem first is such a crucial step because it sets the direction for the entire data mining process. Without a clear goal,
                    the data can become overwhelming and can lead to focusing on irrelevant patterns that stray from the objective. A clearly identified goal, 
                    can determine what data is needed, what features need to be analyzed, which models are used, and what overall goal needs to be achieved. 
                </p>
                <li>Why is data cleaning/pre-processing important? What are some aspects of data that need to be cleaned?</li>
                <p>
                    Data cleaning/pre-processing is essential to the data mining process because raw data is often incomplete, inconsistent, and may contain errors. 
                    Poor quality data can often lead to misleading results which can derail a project completely. Some aspects of data that needs to be cleaned include:
                    missing values, duplicates, errors, outliers, and inconsistent formats such as dates/time.
                </p>
                <li>Example of some data understanding/visualizations. What do you like and/or dislike about it?</li>
