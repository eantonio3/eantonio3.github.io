            <h2>Hair</h2>
            <h3>Haircuts - $50</h3>
            <p>For haircuts, I require a free 10 minute consultation as a part of your deposit to get to know you and your hair type! During this consultation, a time estimate for your service will be given. *Includes a wash and style!*</p>
            <h2>Makeup</h2>
            <p>I offer a few different types of services for makeup, whether it's just a simple everyday look, a classy glam, or a full face beat for events like prom, quinceaneras, or weddings! You can also add on any kind of product you would like used during your service at an additional but affordable cost ($3-$5 per product, not applicable to Full Face Beats)</p>
            <h3>$30</h3>
            <p>Everyday Look, includes a skin tint, brow tint, mascara or small falsies, and 1-2 eyeshadow colors.</p>
            <h3>$85</h3>
            <p>Full Glam, inlcudes medium or full coverage foundation, contour/bronzer and highlighter, falsies, eyeliner, and 3-5 eyeshadow colors.</p>
            <h3>$160</h3>
            <p>Full Face Beat, includes anything and everything you want! Full reign over all the products and any eyeshadow colors you want, with NO additional product fees!</p>
            <h2>Nails</h2>
            <p>I offer five nail sizes and a large variety of colors and charms for nails. Because of this, the cost of manicures are dependent upon a consultation that is completed at the start of your appointment. If you inbox me after you book but before your appointment, I am happy to give you a quote if you have an idea of what you want! Our base prices follow by nail size, as listed below (prices listed are for plain, solid color only - any edits to these will have additional charge)</p>
            <h3>XS - $30</h3>
            <h3>S - $40</h3>
            <h3>M - $55</h3>
            <h3>L - $65</h3>
            <h3>XL - $85 (includes two free nail charms!)</h3>
