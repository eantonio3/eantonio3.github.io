            <h2>Welcome to my website, my name is Josie Upah!</h2>
            <p>Born in Cedar Rapids IA and raised in North Carolina. I come from humble beginnings in Hendersonville, a small town 30 minutes from Asheville, with a mission to bring quality, reliable, and affordable cosmetic services to the Charlotte area that will blow away the competition! I specialize in my makeup services, with it being my area with the most clientelle, and I have since expanded my horizons to include hair services such as cuts and braids, and manicures!</p>
            <h3>I look forward to having you in my chair!</h3>
