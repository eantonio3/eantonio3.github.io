        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
        <h3><a href="https://www.ufc.com">UFC</a></h3>
        <p>
            This is the UFC's offical homepage that showcases their upcoming event
            and the fighter matchups involved on the card. It also offers fight highlights, 
            interviews, fighter statistics, and results of some of the previous events. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Contrast:</b> This site has good contrast, it uses a white background with the
                other elements being darker in color. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Repitition:</b> The things on the site that are repeated are a consistent size,
                font, and color. Things that are more important are bigger and stand out more.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Alignment:</b> The top part of the site has good alignment, the rest of the
                site is aligned in a really weird that leaves a lot of empty space.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Proximity:</b> All of the elements are well spaced out and the things that are
                related are put into the same sections.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a href="http://www.roverp6parts.com/">MGBD Services</a></h3>
        <p>
            This is the website for MGBD Services, a group of Rover P6 Parts Specialists
            based out of Wolverhampton, UK. They offer storage, repair, and restoration 
            services for Rover P6 cars and newer Rover models as well. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Contrast:</b> This site has a decent contrast, the red and cyan color 
                clash and makes it hard to read. The colors in general aren't very
                visualy appealing. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Repitition:</b> Most of the things that are repeated are inconsistent.
                The several images are different sizes and resolutions. The email and phone 
                number are listed on the site several times in different colors and sizes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Alignment:</b> The layout is properly aligned, most of the content is 
                grouped together consistently.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Proximity:</b> The pages are overcrowded with links and low resolution
                pictures. 
            </li>
